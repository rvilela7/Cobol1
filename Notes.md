# Descrive
    - 600 reserved words
    - Cobol Divisions
    
    -- Divisions
    --- Sections
    ---- Paragraphs
    ----- Sentences (IF ... END-IF)
    ------ Statements (ADD, DIVIDE, COMPUTE)

# Notes
    Struggling with a correct case formatting (Reserved versus variable keywords)
    directive SOURCE FORMAT FREE, requires a -F in cobc, so i don't get a warning(note)


# Curiosity
    - Cobol is not case sensitive, although there are guidelines
    - It's my responsability to enforce TYPES
    - A lot of error are due to a miss of extra dot file at end of inner divisions
